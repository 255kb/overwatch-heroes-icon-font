# Overwatch Heroes icon font

## What is it?
This icon font allows you to easily use the stylised Overwatch heroes SVG icons created by DCMJS ([view here](http://dcmjs.com/overwatch/)) in all your web projects. 

## Usage

1. Add `style.css` file content to your project
2. Use a class prefixed by `ohi-` and followed by the hero's name to display the icon and style it like any other text font:

    ```
        <span class="ohi-bastion"></span>
    ```
